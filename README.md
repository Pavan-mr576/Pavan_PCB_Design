This GitHub project contains the design files for a PCB built around a 555 timer chip. You'll find the circuit schematic and the layout for the actual board, both created in Altium Designer.

The project also lists the specific components used, like resistors, capacitors, and the type of 555 timer package. (Feel free to add details about your circuit's function here if it's relevant).

The files are in standard Altium formats, so you can easily open and modify them if you want to tinker with the design.
